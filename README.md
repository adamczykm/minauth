# MinAuth
Rapid development of POC of MinAuth - MinAuth is a library and a set of tools for providing JWT-based authentication protocol that uses SnarkyJS zero-knowledge proofs as the basis of the authentication.  It uses plugins to prove statements about external data such as on-chain data or 3rd-party data.

### Current status

The current code implements minimal authentication flow that recreates the usual passport authentication, but using snarkyjs ZKPs.
